# odin-recipes
# The purpose of this project is to (re-)familiarize myself with HTML as I go through The Odin Project.
# After completing this I should be able to:
# - Create ordered and unordered lists.
# - Link pages together
# - Properly update the README.md file before adding my solution (woops)
