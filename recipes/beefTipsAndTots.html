        <h2>How to make Beef Tips & Tots</h2>
        <p>
            <strong> Beef tips & tots </strong>are a tasty looking recipe I spotted on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/284164/beef-tips-and-tots/"> allrecipes.com</a>. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 &frac12; pounds beef round steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>&frac12; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 &frac14; cups low sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato<br> nuggets (such as Tater Tots&#174;) </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller <br>"tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.</li><br>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef,<br> arrange in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned,
                3 to 5 minutes,<br> before turning over and browning the other side.
            </li><br>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything<br> until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook
                and stir for 1 minute.
            </li><br>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and<br> cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour
                and 15 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce <br>has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>while meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and<br> heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato<br> nuggets.</li><br>
        </ol>
