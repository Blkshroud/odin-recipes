        <h2>How to make Usagi Ringo</h2>
        <p>
            <strong> Usagi ringo </strong>are a common way of preparing apples for children's lunches in Japan. 
            Usagi means rabbit and ringo means apple, so directly translated it would be Bunny apple.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> Usagi ringo </strong> are easy to make as you don't need a lot of things to make them.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients and Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At least one apple (<em> I prefer honeycrisp</em>)</li>
            <li>A <em>very</em> sharp knife (<strong>be <em> extra </em>careful</strong>)</li>
            <li>Optional: an apple corer</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your apple(s)</li>
            <li>Using either the apple corer or your knife cut the apple into 6 or 8 slices</li>
            <li>Take one of the slices, and starting from the middle, cut a reverse V into the skin making sure that it goes through the skin</li>
            <li>Starting from the edge where the V ends use your knife to cut until you reach the point where the lines of the V meet <br>
                <strong>Be sure not to cut too close to the skin or the ears will fall off!</strong></li>
            <li>As long as your cuts in step 3 were deep enough you should be able to remove the V and be left with what looks like a bunny made from your apple.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3-5 until all apple slices have turned into rabbits</li>
        </ol>
